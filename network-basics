4 types of local networks
1) small home networks
2) SOHO networks
3) medu=ium to large networks
4) world wide networks

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

bandwidth is capacity of medium to carry data

throughput: throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. However, due to a number of factors, throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. M
